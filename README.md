# xqifft

Implementation of the XQIFFT algorithm proposed in the paper  ["The XQIFFT: Increasing the accuracy of quadratic interpolation of spectral peaks via exponential magnitude spectrum weighting"](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/i/icmc/bbp2372.2015.066/1/--xqifft-increasing-the-accuracy-of-quadratic-interpolation?page=root;size=150;view=pdf) by K. J. Werner, which I used for my paper ["Speeding Up AC Circuit Co-Simulations through Selective Simulator Decoupling of Predictable States"](http://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907773).
